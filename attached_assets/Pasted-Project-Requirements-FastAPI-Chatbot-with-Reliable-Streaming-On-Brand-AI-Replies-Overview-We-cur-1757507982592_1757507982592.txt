Project Requirements: FastAPI Chatbot with Reliable Streaming & On-Brand AI Replies
Overview

We currently run a chatbot built on FastAPI that streams responses over WebSockets. While functional, the system faces two challenges:

Unstable streaming (sockets freeze mid-response).

Generic AI answers (not sufficiently tailored or engaging).

We need a developer to stabilize the real-time response pipeline and refine the chatbot’s conversation style using OpenAI’s APIs (or similar LLMs).

Functional Requirements
1. WebSocket Debugging & Reliability

Ensure real-time streaming responses are delivered without freezing or early termination.

Handle edge cases: dropped connections, network instability, user disconnect/reconnect.

Implement proper timeout and reconnection handling.

Add logging and monitoring hooks for debugging future socket issues.

2. OpenAI Integration Improvements

Current replies sound generic; refine prompt structure and context passing.

Use system + user + contextual prompts to enforce brand tone and persona.

Explore few-shot prompting to improve consistency across sessions.

Maintain conversation memory (short-term context) so answers feel connected, not isolated.

3. Response Quality & Brand Alignment

Adjust responses to be:

More natural – like a human chat, not robotic.

Brand-specific – tailored to our industry/domain (tone of voice guidelines will be provided).

Helpful & concise – avoiding generic filler text.

Add rules for fallback replies (when OpenAI produces irrelevant output).

4. Performance & Scalability

Optimize FastAPI routes for low latency streaming.

Ensure the system can handle concurrent WebSocket clients.

Optionally support token streaming from OpenAI directly to WebSocket (minimal buffering).

5. Developer Documentation

Provide clear documentation covering:

WebSocket flow & streaming logic.

Prompt design decisions & tuning process.

How to extend or update the bot’s “personality”.

Include environment setup instructions for local development.

Technical Requirements

Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.9+)

WebSockets: Native FastAPI WebSockets or starlette.websockets

LLM Integration: OpenAI API (ChatCompletion / Streaming endpoints)

Data Layer (optional): Redis or Postgres for conversation history

Deployment: Docker + AWS/GCP/Azure (current infra details will be shared)

Monitoring: Logging via Python’s logging or external tool (Sentry, Datadog, etc.)

Deliverables

Stable FastAPI WebSocket Server – no freezes, robust against disconnects.

Refined AI Responses – aligned with brand voice, contextual, human-like.

Prompting Framework – structured system & user prompts with examples.

Documentation – setup, usage, and developer notes.

(Optional) Conversation memory system for improved context awareness.

Success Criteria

Chatbot streams replies smoothly with no mid-response hangs.

Replies sound on-brand, natural, and context-aware.

System handles at least 50 concurrent users without streaming issues.

Developer handover includes full documentation for maintainability.
